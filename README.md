# About the Project
Walmart Inc., one of the largest retailers globally, operates in a highly competitive landscape. This project addresses the pressing need to leverage data analytics to optimize operations and enhance profitability. Traditional methods relying on intuition often yield suboptimal results. Therefore, this project seeks to analyze customer behavior, optimize inventory levels, and develop predictive models to improve decision-making.
